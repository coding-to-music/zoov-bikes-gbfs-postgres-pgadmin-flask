This repository aim to create a basic system to track free bikes provided by [Zoov](https://www.zoov.eu/) in Saclay/South Paris.
The system also keep track of bike usage (total distance traveled for all bikes or for a specific bike, total rented time for all bikes or for a specific bike).

## Usage

Docker is required to build and launch the system.
A simple `docker-compose up --build` in the root directory will build and run all the system services.

## System main components

### Feed Watcher

This component is written in `Python`.
The feed_watcher is taking care of tracking updates from the given feed.
The feed_watcher is parsing and formatting the feed data before loading them to the specified table in the database.

Each feed_watcher is accepting a JSON configuration file which tells: the url of the data feed, the parser to use, how to map the fields with the database, ...

Here only one feed_watcher is used to track data from the [free_bikes_status feed for Saclay/South Paris](https://gateway.prod.zoov.io/gbfs/2.2/saclay/en/free_bike_status.json?key=NGFlMjU3MDUtNDk5My00MTM4LTk1ZjctNmNlNDM1MWQ0NjE1).
His configuration file can be found [here](https://github.com/gaetanlefrioux/zoov_bikes/blob/main/feed_watcher/configs/free_bike_status_saclay.json).



### Database

The `postgres` service holds a PostgreSQL database where the feed data are aggregated and stored

The tables used to stored the data are defined [here](https://github.com/gaetanlefrioux/zoov_bikes/blob/main/db/sql/create_tables.sql)<br>
The logic to aggregate the new data coming from the feed is defined as a SQL function [here](https://github.com/gaetanlefrioux/zoov_bikes/blob/main/db/sql/func_aggregate_free_bikes.sql) for sake of performance.

Additionally, a pgadmin4 container is also running alongside the PostgreSQL container to facilitate monitoring of the database.

## App

The `web_app` service holds a minimalist web application implemented with python and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

This web application is exposed on port `8000`.

This webapp provide two features:<br>
1. At `/free_bikes` you can monitor free bikes available near a given location since a given period of time

2. At `/bikes_statistics` you can monitor the total distance, total rented time and trip count for each bike and overall for a given time window

## Remarks and limitations

First of all, it is import to note that this system is only capable of keeping track of bikes movements because the  [free_bikes_status feed for Saclay/South Paris](https://gateway.prod.zoov.io/gbfs/2.2/saclay/en/free_bike_status.json?key=NGFlMjU3MDUtNDk5My00MTM4LTk1ZjctNmNlNDM1MWQ0NjE1) is not fully following the [GBFS specification for the free_bike_status feed](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.2/gbfs.md#free_bike_statusjson) which says:
- The bike_id identifier MUST be rotated to a random string after each trip to protect user privacy (as of v2.0). Use of persistent vehicle IDs poses a threat to user privacy. The bike_id identifier SHOULD only be rotated once per trip.

Thus, this system might not work on other free_bike_status feeds.


Also, because the system only see bikes that are currently free, it can only deduce bike rental starting and ending points. From these information we can estimate the distance traveled by the bike by computing the direct distance between the two points. However this distance can be fairly different from the real traveled distance.

The system is unable to accurately compute revenue generated by the bikes. This feature could be implemented by adding a feed watcher for the [pricing_plan feed](https://gateway.prod.zoov.io/gbfs/2.2/saclay/en/system_pricing_plans.json?key=NGFlMjU3MDUtNDk5My00MTM4LTk1ZjctNmNlNDM1MWQ0NjE1) to keep track of pricing plan change for each bike.

Connectivity issue between the feed watchers and the database will lead to data loss. To avoid that, new data coming from the watched feed should be cached by the feed watcher. To address this issue and also to grow the system with multiple other feeds a message brocker like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) could be used.
